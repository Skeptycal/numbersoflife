Hi!

You've stumbled on the small corner of the internet where I share my thoughts on math and biology. Perhaps that seems like an odd combination; it certainly would have seemed so to me a few years ago. Memorization and classification—along with the occasional icky dissection—dominate my memories of high school biology. But I was wrong. Or at the least very ill-informed. How do thousands of fireflies synchronize their rhythms to flash in unison?[^1] What makes multi-drug treatments for AIDS much more effective than the same drugs given sequentially?[^2] When did modern humans first migrate out of Africa and where did they go?[^3] Those are all biological questions, but they can’t be answered without math. 

This site is my excuse for writing about the interection of math and biology. I write mostly to clarify my own understanding, but perhaps others will find the topics interesting. The articles will necessarily include both math and science, but don’t feel like you need an advanced degree to understand and enjoy them. (If you do, I’ve failed as a writer. Be sure to let me know so that I can improve.)

If you’re wondering about my own background, currently I’m a doctoral student in [Georgia Tech’s School of Mathematics](http://www.math.gatech.edu) working towards a PhD in [Quantitative BioSciences](http://www.qbios.gatech.edu). It’s still early, and I don’t yet have a thesis topic, but my interests include nonlinear dynamics, stochastic models, and Bayesian statistics. If you do decide to follow this site, I hope you’ll forgive an occasional post on my academic progress.

If you’d like to get in touch, you can reach me at [stephen.thomas@gatech.edu](mailto:stephen.thomas@gatech.edu) or on Twitter as [@stephen_thomas](https://twitter.com/stephen_thomas).
